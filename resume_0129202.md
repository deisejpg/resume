## **💼 Experience**

### **Bioinformatics Scientist** | *BioIVT* *(2022–Present)*  
Company’s data person leading the local bioinformatics team and participating 
in global initiatives. Bridges the communication of data-driven biological insights 
between the company’s leadership and departments such as clinical data, lab operations, 
quality assurance and compliance, and global sales teams.  

#### **📂 Current Projects**
- Implementing and deploying a data product that explores NGS, slide images, and clinical data assets
-	Proposing a new NGS biomarker annotation portfolio for FFPE and ctDNA samples 
-	Exploring Generative AI to extract relevant information from free text in large clinical datasets
-	Collaborated on research exploring the use of FFPE blocks from lab-generated FNAs for molecular 
annotation (to be presented at Molecular TriCon, March 2025)  

#### **📂 Past Projects**
- Developed an NGS pipeline that significantly reduced variant detection error, processing time, 
and ensured reproducibility of biospecimen biospecimen annotation

### **Postdoctoral Researcher** | *University of Michigan* *(2020–2022)*
Conducted analyses to detect structural variants for evolutionary genomics 
([NSF project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1917146&HistoricalAwards=false), 
[publication](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.20200)).  

-	Developed and implemented [various pipelines](https://github.com/deisejpg/manipulating_fastas.git)
to assemble and analyze various NGS datasets, including transcriptomes, nuclear target capture, 
and organelle genomes 
-	Collaborated on projects analyzing venom evolution in 
[snakes](https://github.com/deisejpg/mito-genes_from_transcriptome) 
and developing an [analytical tool](https://github.com/edgardomortiz/sam2consensus) 
for NGS data processing
-	Developed a [method](https://github.com/deisejpg/rosids) to explore organelle genome variants
